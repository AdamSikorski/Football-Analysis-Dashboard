## General info
This is one of the group projects that I was participating in my studies. 
I was responsible for doing visualisations. 
	
## Technologies
This project was about data analysis . There are key steps in a process of data analysis.<br />
**1) Data extraction and some pre-processing of data.**<br />
We used Python to do that. Key libraries in Python to do the data scraping were: Requests, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Numpy.<br />
**2) Data storage**<br />
Data and Python cript were stored in Azure.<br />
**3) Data visualization and some additional processing of data.**<br />
To visualize data I used PowerBI.
